_As always, please understand that some contributions may not get merged. This isn't a reflection of your skills or the quality of your code, but simply how well it fits the project._

### General Guidelines
The tools should be as **fast** and **simple** as possible, but without compromising **usefulness**. A small project like this one does not need any dependencies to achieve this, as such please follow a _zero-dependency principle_ in your contributions to keep the project as lightweight as possible.
