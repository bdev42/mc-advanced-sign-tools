            <h2>Minecraft Sign Editor</h2>
            <p>This tool is meant to help you make ASCII art for Minecraft signs,
                unlike other tools it is designed to perfectly match in-game signs
                with pixel-perfect accuracy.
            </p>
            <b>Why is this tool useful?</b>
            <p>ASCII art is typically made with <i>monospace fonts (= all characters take up the same width)</i>,
                which makes it both considerably easier to create
                and to be reused in any other monospace font without looking
                completely messed up. Unlucky for us, <i>Mojangles (= the minecraft font)</i>,
                is not monospace, which means we have to keep in mind the width of
                each character when making ASCII art, this is the primary use for this tool.
            </p>

            <h3 id="mse-quick-overview">Quick Overview</h3>
            <img src="docs/mse/overview.png">
            <ul>
                <li>To get started, simply start typing into the multi-line <span style="color: #00FF21;">text input</span>, which is located above the sign display (or canvas). </li>
                <li>The buttons next to the canvas let you <span style="color: #FFD800;">copy the text line-by-line</span> so you can easily paste it to an in-game sign. </li>
                <li>Next to it you find the <span style="color: #FF0000;">line width counter</span>, which displays the number of pixels the line currently takes up. It also warns you when a line is over the 90 pixel limit. <i>A dash (-) indicates an unused line, which is not the same as an empty one.</i></li>
                <li>There are numerous additional controls in the <span style="color: #0094FF;">dashboards at the top</span>, you can learn more about them below.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 id="mse-display-options">Display Options</h3>
            <img src="docs/mse/display_options.png" alt="the display options dashboard">
            <p>To preview how exactly your design will look in-game disable "Show Overlay", 
                enable "Center Text" and "Sign Background", finally choose the appropriate dye color (if applicable).
            </p>
            <h4>Show Overlay</h4>
            <p>On by default, the overlay helps you easily determine how much space each character uses, 
                which is very helpful for ASCII art. When enabled, a color legend will be shown below the sign display:
            </p>
            <img src="docs/mse/overlay_color_legend.png" alt="overlay color legend; red = margin, white = baseline, green = space, 
            yellow = gap, blue = ascent, cyan = descent">
            <h4>Center Text</h4>
            <p>Disabled by default for easier editing, enable it to match the in-game behavior. Note how a fully filled 
                line (90/90 pixels) looks the same as if it wasn't centered, this technique lets you more easily control 
                the position of each character in that line.</p>
            <h4>Sign Background</h4>
            <p>On by default, toggles the rendering of the oak sign texture. When disabled, the background is transparent,
                most browsers let you right-click the sign display (canvas) and copy or <b>save the image as a transparent PNG</b>.

            <h4>Cut To Margins</h4>
            <p>Press this to quickly cut the text to the margins of a sign, i.e. 90 pixels wide and 4 lines long at the most.</p>
            <h4>Balance Used Lines</h4>
            <p>Press this to try and <i>balance the text (= make all lines the same width as the longest)</i> using the <b>selected strategy</b>.</p>
            <h5>space only</h5>
            <p>This strategy is limited to the space character, which means it can only increase lines by an increment of 4 pixels,
                as such it cannot always achieve fully balanced lines, it gets you close and then you can fix it the way you want from there.
            </p>
            <h5>space & dots (before / after)</h5>
            <p>This more advanced strategy can almost always achieve perfect balance, with the main downside being possibly adding 
                visible characters. It uses the dot (.) and backtick (`) characters in addition to space, which enable 2 and 3 pixel 
                wide increments as well. The two variants change whether the visible characters (dots) are put <b>before or after</b> the space.
            </p>
            <i>In some circumstances it might increase the width of the longest line as well and balance
                to the new length, such as when there is a single pixel difference between the longest and second longest line. This is because 
                there is no way to add a single pixel width to a line, as even the 1 wide characters add one more pixel for the gap after them.

            <h3>File Format</h3>
            <p>The banner font format (.mast) is a custom text-based file format intended to store custom ascii-art designs for different

                <tr><td>Width</td><td>The (max) width of the character design in pixels.</td></tr>
            </table>
            <p>In the event the <b>height (number of lines)</b> of the design differs from <b>"Max Lines"</b>, the following segment is also inserted:</p>
